# Superpowers

Superpowers is a complete software development methodology for your coding agents, built on top of a set of composable skills and some initial instructions that make sure your agent uses them.

## How it works

It starts from the moment you fire up your coding agent. As soon as it sees that you're building something, it *doesn't* just jump into trying to write code. Instead, it steps back and asks you what you're really trying to do. 

Once it's teased a spec out of the conversation, it shows it to you in chunks short enough to actually read and digest. 

After you've signed off on the design, your agent puts together an implementation plan that's clear enough for an enthusiastic junior engineer with poor taste, no judgement, no project context, and an aversion to testing to follow. It emphasizes true red/green TDD, YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and DRY. 

Next up, once you say "go", it works through each engineering task in the plan, verifying as it goes, then reviews the completed work as a whole before wrapping up. It's not uncommon for Claude to be able to work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.

There's a bunch more to it, but that's the core of the system. In the current model, lightweight tasks stay direct by default. Superpowers workflow kicks in when you explicitly ask for a skill or use a clear workflow keyword such as design, planning, debugging, review, or implementation coordination.


## Sponsorship

If Superpowers has helped you do stuff that makes money and you are so inclined, I'd greatly appreciate it if you'd consider [sponsoring my opensource work](https://github.com/sponsors/obra).

Thanks!

## Installation

**Note:** Installation differs by platform. 

### Claude Code Official Marketplace

Superpowers is available via the [official Claude plugin marketplace](https://claude.com/plugins/superpowers)

Install the plugin from Anthropic's official marketplace:

```bash
/plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official
```

### Claude Code (Superpowers Marketplace)

The Superpowers marketplace provides Superpowers and some other related plugins for Claude Code.

In Claude Code, register the marketplace first:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
```

Then install the plugin from this marketplace:

```bash
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
```

### OpenAI Codex CLI

- Open plugin search interface

```bash
/plugins
```

Search for Superpowers

```bash
superpowers
```

Select `Install Plugin`

### OpenAI Codex App

- In the Codex app, click on Plugins in the sidebar.
- You should see `Superpowers` in the Coding section. 
- Click the `+` next to Superpowers and follow the prompts.


### Cursor (via Plugin Marketplace)

In Cursor Agent chat, install from marketplace:

```text
/add-plugin superpowers
```

or search for "superpowers" in the plugin marketplace.

### Codex

Tell Codex:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joseph-bing-han/superpowers/refs/heads/openspec/.codex/INSTALL.md
```

This Codex path installs the team-maintained `openspec` branch.
It also bootstraps the repo-managed Codex instruction file via `model_instructions_file`, so first-time installs do not need a separate manual config edit.

**Detailed docs:** [docs/README.codex.md](docs/README.codex.md)
### OpenCode

Tell OpenCode:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joseph-bing-han/superpowers/refs/heads/openspec/.opencode/INSTALL.md
```

This OpenCode path installs the team-maintained `openspec` branch.
It loads the repo plugin, registers the repo `skills/` tree, injects the `using-superpowers` bootstrap, and exposes newer skills such as `spec-governed-development`.

**Detailed docs:** [docs/README.opencode.md](docs/README.opencode.md)

### GitHub Copilot CLI

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
copilot plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
```

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/obra/superpowers
```

To update:

```bash
gemini extensions update superpowers
```

### Verify Installation

Start a new session in your chosen platform and ask for something with clear workflow intent (for example, "help me plan this feature" or "let's debug this issue"), or explicitly name a skill. Lightweight tasks such as plain Q&A, translation, or copy-only edits should stay direct instead of triggering the heavyweight workflow.

## The Basic Workflow

1. **brainstorming** - Activates before writing code. Refines rough ideas through questions, explores alternatives, presents design in sections for validation. Saves design document.

2. **writing-plans** - Activates with approved design. Breaks work into bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each). Every task has exact file paths, complete code, verification steps.

3. **executing-plans** - Activates with plan. Works through tasks in the current workspace, running each task's verifications as it goes.

4. **test-driven-development** - Activates during implementation. Enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: write failing test, watch it fail, write minimal code, watch it pass, commit. Deletes code written before tests.

5. **requesting-code-review** - Activates once all tasks are complete. Reviews the whole accumulated diff against the plan, reports issues by severity. Critical issues block progress.

6. **finishing-a-development-branch** - Activates when review passes. Verifies tests, presents options (merge/PR/keep/discard).

**The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.** Mandatory workflows, not suggestions.

## What's Inside

### Skills Library

**Testing**
- **test-driven-development** - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle (includes testing anti-patterns reference)

**Debugging**
- **systematic-debugging** - 4-phase root cause process (includes root-cause-tracing, defense-in-depth, condition-based-waiting techniques)
- **verification-before-completion** - Ensure it's actually fixed

**Collaboration** 
- **brainstorming** - Socratic design refinement
- **writing-plans** - Detailed implementation plans
- **executing-plans** - Task execution with batch review before finishing
- **requesting-code-review** - Review the completed work against the plan
- **receiving-code-review** - Responding to feedback
- **finishing-a-development-branch** - Merge/PR decision workflow
- **spec-governed-development** - OpenSpec governance entrypoint for larger changes

**Meta**
- **writing-skills** - Create new skills following best practices (includes testing methodology)
- **using-superpowers** - Introduction to the skills system

## Philosophy

- **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests first, always
- **Systematic over ad-hoc** - Process over guessing
- **Complexity reduction** - Simplicity as primary goal
- **Evidence over claims** - Verify before declaring success

## Contributing

The general contribution process for Superpowers is below. Keep in mind that we don't generally accept contributions of new skills and that any updates to skills must work across all of the coding agents we support.

1. Fork the repository
2. Switch to the 'dev' branch
3. Create a branch for your work
4. Follow the `writing-skills` skill for creating and testing new and modified skills
5. Submit a PR, being sure to fill in the pull request template.

See `skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md` for the complete guide.

## Updating

Superpowers updates are somewhat coding-agent dependent, but are often automatic.
