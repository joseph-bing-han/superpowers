# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Help turn ideas into fully formed design artifacts through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Anti-Pattern: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Design"

Every project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function utility, a config change — all of them. "Simple" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be short (a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and get approval.

## Checklist

You MUST create a task for each of these items and complete them in order:

1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits
2. **Offer visual companion** (if topic will involve visual questions) — this is its own message, not combined with a clarifying question. See the Visual Companion section below.
3. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria; prefer numbered options when the choices are already known
4. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation
5. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section using numbered choices instead of typed approval words
6. **Write design artifacts** — in a Superpowers-only lane, save to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` and commit; in an OpenSpec-governed lane, update the relevant OpenSpec change artifacts and commit without creating a duplicate Superpowers spec file
7. **Design artifact review loop** — dispatch spec-document-reviewer subagent with precisely crafted review context (never your session history); review the written design artifacts, fix issues, and re-dispatch until approved (max 3 iterations, then surface to human)
8. **User reviews written design artifacts** — ask user to review the written design artifact paths before proceeding
9. **Transition to implementation** — invoke writing-plans skill to create implementation plan

}
```

**The terminal state is invoking writing-plans.** Do NOT invoke frontend-design, mcp-builder, or any other implementation skill. The ONLY skill you invoke after brainstorming is writing-plans.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Before asking detailed questions, assess scope: if the request describes multiple independent subsystems (e.g., "build a platform with chat, file storage, billing, and analytics"), flag this immediately. Don't spend questions refining details of a project that needs to be decomposed first.
- If the project is too large for a single spec, help the user decompose into sub-projects: what are the independent pieces, how do they relate, what order should they be built? Then brainstorm the first sub-project through the normal design flow. Each sub-project gets its own spec → plan → implementation cycle.
- For appropriately-scoped projects, ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer numbered options when asking clarifying questions with known choices
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**

- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**

- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far, using numbered approvals instead of requiring typed approval words
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

For approval gates, prefer patterns like:

```text
1. Agree and continue
2. Request changes
3. Input other feedback or requirements
```

Avoid requiring the user to type approval words like "agree", "approved", or "go ahead".

**Design for isolation and clarity:**

- Break the system into smaller units that each have one clear purpose, communicate through well-defined interfaces, and can be understood and tested independently
- For each unit, you should be able to answer: what does it do, how do you use it, and what does it depend on?
- Can someone understand what a unit does without reading its internals? Can you change the internals without breaking consumers? If not, the boundaries need work.
- Smaller, well-bounded units are also easier for you to work with - you reason better about code you can hold in context at once, and your edits are more reliable when files are focused. When a file grows large, that's often a signal that it's doing too much.

**Working in existing codebases:**

- Explore the current structure before proposing changes. Follow existing patterns.
- Where existing code has problems that affect the work (e.g., a file that's grown too large, unclear boundaries, tangled responsibilities), include targeted improvements as part of the design - the way a good developer improves code they're working in.
- Don't propose unrelated refactoring. Stay focused on what serves the current goal.

## After the Design

**Documentation:**

- In a **Superpowers-only lane**, write the validated design artifact to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
  - (User preferences for spec location override this default)
- In an **OpenSpec-governed lane**, update the relevant OpenSpec change artifacts instead of creating a duplicate Superpowers spec document
  - In that lane, OpenSpec artifacts are the canonical record for scope, design, and requirements
  - Do NOT maintain a parallel `docs/superpowers/specs/...` file covering the same change
- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available
- Commit the resulting design artifact(s) to git

**Design Artifact Review Loop:**
After writing the design artifact(s):

1. Dispatch spec-document-reviewer subagent (see spec-document-reviewer-prompt.md)
   - In a **Superpowers-only lane**, provide the path to the written design artifact
   - In an **OpenSpec-governed lane**, provide the relevant OpenSpec artifact paths
2. If Issues Found: fix, re-dispatch, repeat until Approved
3. If loop exceeds 3 iterations, surface to human for guidance

**User Review Gate:**
After the design artifact review loop passes, ask the user to review the written design artifacts before proceeding:

> "Design artifacts written and committed to `<path-or-paths>`. Choose the next step:
> 1. Agree and continue
> 2. Request changes
> 3. Input other feedback or requirements"

Wait for the user's response. If they request changes, make them and re-run the design artifact review loop. Only proceed once the user approves.

**Implementation:**

- Invoke the writing-plans skill to create a detailed implementation plan
- Do NOT invoke any other skill. writing-plans is the next step.

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Numbered choices preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when concrete choices are known
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design, get approval before moving on
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense

## Visual Companion

A browser-based companion for showing mockups, diagrams, and visual options during brainstorming. Available as a tool — not a mode. Accepting the companion means it's available for questions that benefit from visual treatment; it does NOT mean every question goes through the browser.

**Offering the companion:** When you anticipate that upcoming questions will involve visual content (mockups, layouts, diagrams), offer it once for consent:
> "Some of what we're working on might be easier to explain if I can show it to you in a web browser. I can put together mockups, diagrams, comparisons, and other visuals as we go. This feature is still new and can be token-intensive. Want to try it? (Requires opening a local URL)"

**This offer MUST be its own message.** Do not combine it with clarifying questions, context summaries, or any other content. The message should contain ONLY the offer above and nothing else. Wait for the user's response before continuing. If they decline, proceed with text-only brainstorming.

**Per-question decision:** Even after the user accepts, decide FOR EACH QUESTION whether to use the browser or the terminal. The test: **would the user understand this better by seeing it than reading it?**

- **Use the browser** for content that IS visual — mockups, wireframes, layout comparisons, architecture diagrams, side-by-side visual designs
- **Use the terminal** for content that is text — requirements questions, conceptual choices, tradeoff lists, A/B/C/D text options, scope decisions

A question about a UI topic is not automatically a visual question. "What does personality mean in this context?" is a conceptual question — use the terminal. "Which wizard layout works better?" is a visual question — use the browser.

If they agree to the companion, read the detailed guide before proceeding:
